%                    IPOPT MATLAB Files for Use with GPOPS-II                    %
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% This directory contains the precompiled IPOPT mex files for use with GPOPS-II. %
% The required paths are set automatically by running the path setup script.     %
% This directory contains two sets of mex files.  The first set of mex files is  %
% found in the directory originalMumpsMexFiles and contains mex files that have  %
% been compiled with the linear solver MUMPS.  The second set of mex files is    %
% found in the directory ma57andMumpsMexFile and contains mex files that have    %
% been compiled with both MUMPS and the MATLAB version of the linear solver MA57.%
% If for some reason either of these sets of mex files are not adequate for you, %
% you can compile your own IPOPT mex file by following the instructions on the   %
% IPOPT project page.                                                            %
