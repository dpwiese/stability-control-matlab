# Matlab Stability and Control Codes

This repository contains various Matlab code written as part of class work during my graduate studies focusing on control systems.
These codes are not well written, may never have run when they were written (in most cases more than a decade ago) and more still may not run on newer versions of Matlab today.
There are certainly errors.
The problem sets which these codes were written to solve are not present in this repository, so this lack of context will make using these codes more difficult still.
Lastly, for any ongoing work towards which this code may be helpful, Matlab is almost certainly the wrong tool for the job - any value snippets of code should be able to be converted to e.g. Python with relative ease.
At best, this code may be a helpful reference.
Use at your own risk.
